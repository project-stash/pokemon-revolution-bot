You need ProClient with 1024 x 768 resolution size. To use the program, simply run guiclient.py and select what pokemon you want and add it in pokemonHuntList. If a pokemon name is recognized in encounter, it should shows up beside PokemonFound. The program simulates keyboard movement and it should blend in with real players.
If you it doesnt work, you can simply encounter a pokemon and run realbot.py to to see if it needs adjustment. If you don't understand, simply ask.
